# Linear-Regression-1
For data, we are using USA_Housing dataset wherein we are going to write algorithms based on Linear Regression. The data contains 500 rows and 7 columns. We'll try to find the best fit line so that loss functions are minimum and we achieve the best fit line for the data.
Steps used---
a) Importing the dependencies like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn
b) Importing the data to read what's contained in the dataset.
c) Basic data exploration using head, info.
d) EDA using pairplot, corelation, heatmap and distplot
e) Train Test split the datset.
f) Feature scaling using standard scaler.
g) Importing Linear regression model
h) Predictions to be done on testing dataset.
i) Regression evaluation metrics i.e MAE, MSE, RMSE
j) Getting individual coefficients.
k) Conclusion.
Conclusion: From the coefficients, it's clear that Avg. Area Income feature is the major factor in deciding the price of the house. Thus, if the income of people in the area is high, the price of house is going to be higher.
